                <p>Below are some past and current projects that I have been working on. They vary quite a lot in their scope and design, and they come from
                a variety of intentions: past course projects, personal projects sparked from my curiousity, and designathons and hackathons.</p>
                <p>Engineering is all about creating prototypes and projects and applying and designing 
                around the constraints of physics, science, and economics.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy my curation of works.</p>

                <p>I have been a part of this design team since January 2022. This collection showcases my contributions to the team, which include:
                manufacturing parts using the student machine shop, leading sub-assemblies, and create component and assembly drawings. </p>

                <p>This was a design project for the mechanics of deformation course. We explored the different forces 
                that a truss system can experience, and we had a design competition to optimize the bridge
                with these forces in mind. </p>

                <p>This project was done during the weekend-long McMaster University Designathon
                in March 2022. The event focused on designing a capsule for a several month long
                journey to Mars. Our planning, design, and presentation led us to receive
                Second Place at the event.</p>

                <p>Being the yearbook editor was the culmination of my high school experiences ‚Äî a true kaleidoscope featuring it all. It was one of 
                my greatest experiences as a high school student and leader, and in many ways allowed me to take an omniscient perspective 
                of my high school. This made it truly extraordinary to be able to see the book come together, work on the graphics,
                and steer the direction of the book and the creative elements.</p>

                <p>This was my Scout group&apos;s 20th anniversary. Similar to my experience in yearbook, this book required to bring everything together 
                and showcase it in a limited 80 pages. I worked on the full design of the book and had a chance to communicate with a number of stakeholders 
                to create the book.</p>
